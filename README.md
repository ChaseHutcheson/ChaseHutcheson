# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chase Hutcheson, and I'm and aspiring software developer currently pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science at Youngstown State University! I really enjoy problem-solving, learning new/modern coding languages and frameworks like React, React Native, Angular, .NET, and Ruby, and I have a deep appreciation of computer history. Some other things about me would be my love of playing guitar, playing video games and robotics.

## Skills
To save myself time and give you a better understanding of my skillset, I have created a repository that I will regularly update with all my coding knowledge whenever I learn something new. You can find [here](https://github.com/ChaseHutcheson/Tutorials).
