# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chase Hutcheson, an I'm and aspiring software developer currently pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science at Youngstown State University! I really enjoy problem-solving, learning new/modern coding languages and frameworks like React, React Native, Angular, .NET, and Ruby, and I have a deep appreciation of computer history. Some other things about me would be my love of playing guitar, playing video games and robotics.
